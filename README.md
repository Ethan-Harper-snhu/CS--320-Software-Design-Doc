# The Gaming Room client had previously built a game for mobile Android phones and required a new port of the game be created as a browser app on desktop.
# I believe I did particualarly well at identifying the clients needs and picking out what OS would be best for their development.
# Having clear guidelines previously built out in a diagram or psuedocode can help with the overall flow and forward progress since I always know what I need to accomplish and have a relative idea on how to do it.
# I would improve on my break down of the benefits of each OS
# The user's needs are always the most important to consider when designing.
